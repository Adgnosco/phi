## Definitions

> Beyond reality.

The intention of most metaphysical philosophers are matched, so their focus reside the generality in nature.

> At the side of Physics.

A general roman gave this literal name as an attempt to order and translate piles of papers of Aristotle, known as the *Aristotelic canon*. As time passes, it is lost, and after it was recovered by the muslins of Al-Ándalus, it was translated again in latin by the christians erudites as they found muslin texts. 
## Ontology

> Study of things.

> Study of beings in general.

### Pythagoras
- All things are numbers.
- The cosmos comes from numerical principles.
	- The physical world, the matter, is an imitation of the eternal mathematical world, the form.
### Heraclitus
- Movement and panta rhei. (Impermanence)
- The logos like the supreme fire. (Dinamic)
### Parmenides
- Being is and non-being is not. (Permanence)
- The logos like the perfect sphere. (Static)
- “There _is_ a void; therefore the void is not nothing; therefore there is not the void”. (Immovable)
### Leucippus
- All things can be divided until it is impossible to divide, thus, fundamental particle is that. (Atomism & monism)
	- Infinite number and kinds of atoms. (Pluralism) 
- Being is and non-being is. (Dualism)
	- The non-being is, so the void is.
	- The being is, so the atom is.
- The movement, therefore, is. (Movable)
### Gorgias
- Being is not and non-being is. (Relativism)
	- Nothing is. (Nihilism)
	- Even if something is, nothing can be known about it. (Agnosticism)
	- Even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it can't be communicated to others. (Skepticism)
	- Even if it can be communicated, it cannot be understood. (Skepticism)
### Democritus
- Atoms are fundamental particle of all things. (Atomism & monism)
	- Indestructible.
	- Always have been and always will be in motion.
- "The more any indivisible exceeds, the heavier it is”.
	- The mass of things depends on the quantity of atoms they possess.
### Zhuangzi
- “Zhuangzi dreamt that he was a butterfly. In awakening, he ignored if he was Zhuangzi that had dreamt that he was a butterfly or if he was a butterfly and he was dreaming that he was Zhuangzi”. (Skepticism)
	- If one knows the distinction between both, how can one say if one is already slept or awake?
	- Then, it is impossible to find out.
	- Therefore, this is the transformation of the things.
### Socrates
- Being is essence.
- Being is and non-being is not. (Eleatic essentialism)
### Plato
- Being is and non-being is not. (Eleatic essentialism)
- The essence, the universal, is idea. (Theory of forms)
	- Form = Idea
	- Three transcendentals of being.
		- Truth
		- Beauty
		- Good
- Particular is material, derived from universal.
- Two corresponding world. (Dualism)
	- One perfect & the other an imperfect copy.
	- One inmovible & the other movible.
	- One reality & the other appearance. (Allegory of the cave)
	- Inteligible world & sensible world.
- One authentic reality. (Realism of ideas)
### Aristotle
- Substance has material and form. (Hylemorphism and dualism)
- “Being is said in many ways”.
	- Being is and non-being is not (Eleatism)
	- Being is = Entity = Thing
	- Being as substantial (Essentialism)
		- The form of beings allows to be what it is. (Permanence)
	- Being as accident (Contingent)
		- The material of being allows the change without altering the essence. (Dinamic)
- One real world. (Realism & monism)

- Essence is idea, or form. (Plato)
- Phenomenon is the one we know a posteriori within our nature capabilities, without altering their aspect. (Emmanuel Kant and Aristotle)
- Essence can’t be material, nor substantial. (Idealism)
- Thus, phenomenon does not have essence in it. (Heraclitus)
- The assimilation aspect of phenomenon to form makes our intuitive rationality to point essence to them, and not the form. (Plato)
	- For this reason, Plato realise that true philosophers are the ones who appreciate the three trascendentals of being while contemplating at them. 
- Forms and aspects are not the same. (Plato)
- All things from nature are composed by atoms. (Atomism)
- Atoms always move, they never stop; even if they are stuck with themselves, they still move because they vibrate. (Atomism)
- While the forms are immutable and permanent, they still firmly are to be in present, so it is to speak and to think. (Parmenides)
- All things from nature are entities.
- All things from ideas are essentials.
- Our universe, formed by entities, is one, referring as one world, while the one connecting to our consciousness is another world, belonging all the essence.
- Science’s objective is to understand our universe by transcending entities to essentials or creating essentials from entities. (Existentialism)
## Theology
> Study of God, Goddess, or deities.
### Pythagoras
- The number one is divine.
- The tetraktys is divine, so ten is perfect.
### Socrates
- “Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods? (Skepticism)
### Plato
- Divinity is perfect and has the ==three transcendentals of being==, so the forms are divine.
	- Truth
	- Beauty
	- Good
- Participation of divinity is also divine, then the materials are too.
- Nature is, therefore, divine itself.
- Thus, “God is the measure of all things”.
### Aristotle
- The first unmoved motor is divine.
- God does not have a material for itself, so God’s existence is an exception.
- Due to its exception, empirical knowledge can’t reveal it.
- God is perfect, and has all attributes.
### Renatus Cartesius
- Res infinita is identified as God.
	- Substantia in strict sense.
	- Res infinita is perfect, not a thinking, nor a extension.
### Gottfried Leibniz
- The existence of universe is a gift from God.
- God’s creation always tends to be good.
- Thus, there is more good than bad.
- So, “this world is the greatest from all”. (Optimism)
### Immanuel Kant
- God is outside of time and space.
- God is the reason of the universe’s existence.
- Only a priori can let us know him.

- God is unknown for us.
- No knowledge from them can be gained, even if it is a priori or a posteriori.
- Their existence is not revealed.
- Whether we refer God, Goddess, or Gods, we can’t procede the investigation.
